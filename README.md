# âš¡ n8n Workflows by Mahnoor Arif

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains a collection of **automation workflows** I created in [n8n](https://n8n.io).  
These workflows explore different use cases such as **AI agents, sentiment analysis, invoice automation, document Q&A, and multi-agent systems**.  

By building these, I learned how to connect multiple tools, APIs, and AI models into seamless pipelines that can save time, reduce repetitive tasks, and demonstrate the power of automation.

## ðŸŽ¯ What I Learned
- How to design and connect workflows in **n8n**  
- Using **triggers** (Google Sheets, Gmail, RSS feeds, etc.) to automate processes  
- Integrating **OpenAI** for tasks like summarization, translation, and sentiment analysis  
- Structuring pipelines into **multi-agent systems** where each agent has a specialized role  
- Handling real-world automation challenges (filtering, deduplication, updating rows instead of duplicating, etc.)

## ðŸš€ Why These Workflows Are Useful
- **AI + Automation** â†’ Automates tasks like scraping news, generating summaries, and translations.  
- **Business Productivity** â†’ Handles invoices, HR onboarding, and finance tracking.  
- **Data Analysis** â†’ Sentiment analysis of news/social media helps monitor trends.  
- **Scalability** â†’ Workflows can be reused, extended, and combined into larger multi-agent systems.

## ðŸ”§ How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open your **n8n instance** (self-hosted or cloud).  
3. Import the `.json` workflows into n8n.  
4. Configure credentials for Google, OpenAI, or any other service used.  
5. Run and customize the workflows to your own needs.

## ðŸŒŸ Closing Note
This repository reflects my journey of learning **automation and AI integration** with n8n.  
Each workflow demonstrates how powerful no-code/low-code tools can be when combined with modern AI.  

Feel free to explore, adapt, and improve these workflows!
